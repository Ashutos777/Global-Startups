## SAMPLE VISUALIZATION - 


* First I have Cleaned the Null values and duplicates by using Tableau data interpreter option.

* Secondly I have used the filter option which is placed in the top right corner to filter the data of founded year by selecting the range of values. 

* Then I have checked the datatypes of all columns of the dataset whether it is correct or not.
